# Python Based Text Encryptor
## Description
A simple python script to encrypt and decrypt text using a password

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

â›­ Copy this repo or download main.py file and execute it !!!

## Usage

### Encryption

This script takes a message and password in input and after sucessfull encryption its genaretes a ```out.enc``` file whic has the encrypted message its basically a text file with lots of numbers and its hard to decrypt by normal people (easy job for nerds)

### Decryption
Make sure to put the ```out.enc``` file in same directory as that of script and script has read permission. if you enter the correct password it will show the correct text

## Disclamer
 Its not a super secure encryption (TBH, Its plain math)
 <br>[BUG] While decrypting if you enter wrong password it will still give some text insted of wrong password
 <br>This is seriously Slow so dont try to encrypt a full book (Well you can but speed will be awfull!)
