### Encryption

This script takes a message and password in input and after sucessfull encryption its genaretes a ```out.enc``` file whic has the encrypted message its basically a text file with lots of numbers and its hard to decrypt by normal people (easy job for nerds)

Make sure to put the ```out.enc``` file in same directory as that of script and script has read permission. if you enter the correct password it will show the correct text
